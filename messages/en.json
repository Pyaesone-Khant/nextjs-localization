    "intro": "Welcome to the next-intl docs! In this guide you will learn how to set up internationalization (i18n) in your Next.js app. With Next.js 13, the App Router along with support for React Server Components was introduced and announced as stable with version 13.4. Following the lead of Next.js, next-intl also recommends this paradigm since it increases both simplicity as well as flexibility when it comes to i18n."
